# SimpleBlacklist
### Version 1.0.0



## Description 
* *SimpleBlacklist comes with many different functions, however, the main functions this script brings is the ability to blacklist certain vehicles from the server, however, not only does it come with a blacklist, you also have the option to change it from a blacklist, to a whitelist! Basically, the script has a function implemented where if you want to run it as a WHITELIST, all you have to do is change a config item from FALSE to TRUE allowing you to use all the options as if you are whitelising a user to use a vehicle, weapon, or ped.*

* *This script uses AcePerms which are built into FiveM Core itself, but you also can use DiscordAcePerms with the creation of groups. For example: You can do "add_ace group.aadmin simpleblacklist.ModVehicles" this would give anyone with the group permission ***group.admin*** the ability to use the vehicles meant for the moderation team and so on for the administration team using "add_ace group.admin simpleblacklist.AdminVehicles"! See more information about permissions down more in this file!*
